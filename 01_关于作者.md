本书的作者，我本人， Vincent Ruan， 是一个软件工程师。

在这个行业从事了多年的工作，但似乎并不算成功。先后在通信设备、人工智能应用等领域工作过。我感觉自己游离于主流之外；历史、宗教、哲学、经济学都是我曾经发生过兴趣的领域，但只能说对这些领域有粗浅的了解。

对这个时代的技术精英和有影响力的大鳄，曾经也非常敬佩和羡慕，比如马斯克、乔布斯、巴菲特、芒格、查理·芒格等， 但从自我认知的角度， 我自己并不是这样的天才人物。

在徜徉人生的过程中，也许是在人们所认为的不求上进的状态中， 有时或有，感受到宇宙的脉搏，体认到神意幽微与博大。

感谢主，让我在一生的旅程中，遭遇困顿与困惑，也遭遇温暖与希望；这一切造就了今天的自我， 也更体会到神的眷顾和恩慈。每当念及此，我不再羡慕千金之才、万众瞩目之势、万人匍匐之权、青春驻颜之美，我心已得自由，从此有盼望。

作为受到多年严格科学与理性训练的工程师， 曾困惑于实然世界和科学理论与神意的冲突，困惑于基督教在近世的衰微。我曾于各种书籍中试图寻找答案，也曾试图在网络中寻找名牧有关及此的片言只语，更试图能找到牧师能答疑解惑，然而我终于发现世上的言语所不能之处。

然而神意终归是要我们得丰盛的自由，在这些困惑中，我自信和感恩得到神意的启示；我的意图并非以此为求取名望的阶梯，但愿它像一叶扁舟，在时间之河中偶遇那些孤独思索的心灵，能与他们的心智共鸣，并能带给他们一些安慰。倘能如此，就符合本书的主旨了。愿从主来的平安充满你们的内心，愿主保佑你们！

The author, Vincent Ruan, is a software engineer by profession.

Though I have spent years in this industry—working across fields such as telecommunications and artificial intelligence applications—I do not consider myself "successful" in the conventional sense. I have often felt like an outsider to the mainstream. My intellectual curiosities have spanned history, religion, philosophy, and economics, yet my understanding of these disciplines remains that of a humble seeker rather than a specialized scholar.

There was a time when I looked upon the technological elites and influential titans of our era—Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger—with profound admiration and envy. Yet, through the lens of self-awareness, I have come to accept that I am not such a "genius."

As I have wandered through the currents of life—at times in a state that others might label as "lacking ambition"—I have occasionally felt the pulse of the universe and perceived the subtle, yet magnificent, workings of Divine Providence.

I thank the Lord for the journey of my life, which has been marked by both hardship and confusion, as well as warmth and hope. All of this has shaped my current self and deepened my realization of God’s care and grace. Reflecting on this, I no longer envy extraordinary talent, the allure of the spotlight, the reach of absolute power, or the fleeting beauty of youth. My heart has found its freedom; henceforth, I have hope.

As an engineer trained in the rigors of science and rationality, I was long troubled by the apparent conflict between the "is" (the manifest world/scientific theory) and Divine Providence, as well as by the perceived decline of Christianity in the modern age. I sought answers in countless books, searched for fragments of insight from renowned pastors online, and hoped to find mentors who could resolve my doubts—only to discover the inherent limitations of worldly language.

Yet, the Divine Will ultimately intends for us to have abundant freedom. Amidst these perplexities, I am confident and grateful to have received a measure of revelation. My intention is not to use this record as a ladder to fame. Instead, let it be a small skiff upon the river of time, occasionally encountering other souls in solitary reflection. If it can resonate with their intellect and offer some comfort, the purpose of this book is fulfilled. May the peace of the Lord fill your hearts. God bless you.
